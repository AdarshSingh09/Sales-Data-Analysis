## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used
To answer these questions, the following methods and techniques were utilized:
- **Data Manipulation**:
  - Concatenating multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame using `pd.concat`.
  - Adding new columns by parsing existing data.
  - Applying custom logic with `.apply()` and performing aggregate analysis with `.groupby()`.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Creating bar charts and line graphs to visualize sales trends.
  - Styling and labeling graphs for better readability.
